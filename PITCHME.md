@title[About Me]
### About Me
@css[fragment](I make maps...)@css[fragment](and web mapping applications...@css[fragment](and wrangle spatial data...)@css[fragment](to create visualizations to tell a story about physical or social phenomena.)
+++
**Everything from glaciers in South America...**

+++
**To Bird Scooter usage in my hometown...**
![bird scooter map](images/birdmap.PNG) 
+++
@css[fragment](**My training is in physical geography and geospatial technology...**)

@css[fragment](**but increasingly I work with folks outside my discipline**) 
+++
**Folks from...**
- Urban planning |
- Humanities |
- Engineering |
- Biology |
- Social work |
- Anthropology | 
- And more... |
+++
#### The Spatial Advantage
@css[fragment](Geographers know that where things happen, and how the locations of different people, events, and natural phenomenon relate to each other is KEY to understanding them.)

@css[fragment](Digital mapping and spatial thinking are being recognized as an essential component of projects that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries.) 
+++
#### Complete the following statement...
@css[fragment](Everything happens...) @css[fragment](SOMEWHERE!)

### GIS and Remote Sensing 
> @size[.6em](A geographic information system <GIS> is a framework for gathering, managing, and analyzing data. Rooted in the science of geography, GIS integrates many types of data. It analyzes spatial location and organizes layers of information into visualizations using maps and 3D scenes. ​With this unique capability, GIS reveals deeper insights into data, such as patterns, relationships, and situations—helping users make smarter decisions.)

##### Our Scenario...
- A dangerous chemical spills from a local factory, threatening the surrounding neighborhoods!
- The chemical spill will affect all residents within 1 mile of the factory
- But! Because the chemical flows downhill, houses that are on higher ground are safe!
- Who do we need to evacuate?

#### Common GIS Applications
##### Demographic Mapping/Social Sciences
- Where are vulnerable populations located?
- How do environmental hazards differential impact different social groups
- Environmental Justice?

+++
##### Site Selection
- Where should a new business be located?
  - Where are the customers?
  - How far will they have to travel? 
  - Will they buy your product?
  - Where is the competition located?

+++
##### Logistics/Transportation
- How can we minimize transportation costs?
- What is the best route for the UPS truck?
- Do we need a new TARC route due to population growth?

@title[remote sensing basics]
#### remote sensing
> Remote sensing is the science and art of obtaining information about an object, area, or phenomenon through the analysis of data acquired by a device that is not in contact with the object, area, or phenomenon under investigation
- Lillesand et al., 2008
- What does that mean?? 
+++
@title[measurement from distance]
Hearing, seeing, smelling are all remote sensing, but here we focus on one kind: 
Measurement, by satellite-borne sensors (mostly), of the electromagnetic energy reflected or emitted from objects on the Earth’s surface.
+++
@title[measurement from distance]
Specifically, we will focus on observations of Earth’s land and water surfaces by means of reflected and emitted electromagnetic energy
+++
@title[measurement from distance]
Remote sensing is an applied science and is a tool to help understand other fields such as ecology, climatology, geology, soil science and hydrology
