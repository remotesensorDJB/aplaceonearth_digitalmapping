### GIS and Remote Sensing 
> @size[.6em](A geographic information system <GIS> is a framework for gathering, managing, and analyzing data. Rooted in the science of geography, GIS integrates many types of data. It analyzes spatial location and organizes layers of information into visualizations using maps and 3D scenes. ​With this unique capability, GIS reveals deeper insights into data, such as patterns, relationships, and situations—helping users make smarter decisions.)

### Multidisciplinary Digital Mapping Initiatives
###### Humanities
- Recent move towards "Digital Humanities" |
- Digital Humanities Initiatives popping up all over the place! |
- What is Digital Humanities? |
+++

###### Digital Humanities
**A useful definition**
> @size[.6em]("The phrase Digital Humanities… describes not just a collective singular but also the humanities in the plural, able to address and engage disparate subject matters across **media**, language, **location**, and history. But, however heterogeneous, the Digital Humanities is unified by its emphasis on making, connecting, interpreting, and collaborating") 

- <span STYLE = "font-size:.6em">["Digital Humanities"](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/9780262018470_Open_Access_Edition.pdf), by Anne Burdick, Johanna Drucker, Peter Lunenfeld, Todd Presner, Jeffrey Schnapp</span>
+++

**And another...**
> @size[.6em]("DH values collaboration, plurality, investigation of human culture, and the disruption of and reflection on traditional practices...the **use of digital technology for humanities projects changes the user’s experience**. The term “digital humanities” is very broad, and contains multitudes, but examples of “digital humanities” practices might include the **use of existing digital tools for research, to display data in new and revelatory ways, or to bring research to new audiences**.")

- <span STYLE = "font-size:.6em">[THATCamp LAC 2012](http://thatcamp.org/), from a collaborative [Glossary of Digital Humanities](https://docs.google.com/document/d/129_260mbp6C6JaqmylmhMTXA1sv7YYQ0OLsAOAOoCJE/edit?usp=sharing)</span>
+++

### Geohumanities
- Geography has recognized the intersection of humanities and spatial thinking, including digital mapping. 
- AAG's semiannual journal [*Geohumanities: Space, Place and the Humanities*](http://www.aag.org/cs/publications/journals/gh) stands as an example.
- **Storymapping** is a burgeoning tool for engaging audiences with humanities projects
+++

### Storymapping
> @size[.6em] Story Maps are **lightweight web applications** that mash up interactive GIS **maps**, photos/videos and other **multimedia content**, and text-based **narratives**, to tell a story about places or phenomena that are explicitly located in space and time. 
+++

### Storymapping
> @size[.6em] Story Maps leverage modern web development tools to provide an  **engaging, dynamic user experience** that grounds your story in its **geographic setting**.
+++

### Kentucky Black Freedom Map

### Literary Louisville
##### Mapping Literary Culture
- Collaboration with English Department
- Idea: Let's map **everything** related to literary culture in Louisville!
- Generate an extensive database which we can draw upon to build maps related to any theme we wish! 
+++

### Literary Louisville
- Place and space often play a key role in literary works
	- Explicitly (place is part of the story itself)
	- Implicitly (real world events and geography shape trajectory of literature in general)
+++

### Literary Louisville
- Phenomena associated with literature often have a location component
	- Events (whether real or fictional)
	- People (authors, characters, etc.)
	- Places (literary settings, libraries, publishing houses, theatres)
+++

### Literary Louisville
- What does “mapping the humanities” and in this case “Literary Louisville” look like? 
- What kinds of features are of interest? 
- What do we want to know about our data? How does it get recorded?
- What tools are available? 
- How can we manage and use the data collected? 
+++

### Literary Louisville
- How do we get from conceptual model → data model? 
	- Data attributes become fields in a table.
- Fields may have domains – lists or ranges of valid values for each attribute.
- Example: Literary Site Type:
	- Place
	- Event
	- Person
	- Text
	- Other
+++

### Literary Louisville
**Importance of well-designed data model**
- Insures data integrity through use of attribute domains
- Streamlines data entry in field by limiting manual data input 
- Specificity to analyze data at most granular level
- Comprehensiveness and flexibility to account for potentially irregular and non-conforming data (a catch-all)
+++

### Literary Louisville
**The solution**
![server stack](images/serverstack.jpg) 
+++

### Literary Louisville
**Database can be consumed in...**

### Literary Louisville
##### Lessons Learned
**If you build it, you must maintain it!**

@css[fragment](A database without a finite scope needs constant updating with new features, and removal of old ones...who is the steward?)
+++

### Literary Louisville
##### Lessons Learned
**Cloud-based data hosting has its advantages**

@css[fragment](Hosting the database on a local server allows for more functionality, but at the expense of failover capacity and downtime due to software updates and power outages)
+++

### Literary Louisville
##### Lessons Learned
**Start small and scale up**

@css[fragment](Focus on building simple, impactful applications rather than shooting for the moon)
